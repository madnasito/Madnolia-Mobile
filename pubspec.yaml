# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/platforms/
    - assets/i18n/
    - assets/madnolia-logo.svg
    - assets/madnolia-home-logo.png
    - assets/icon.png
    - shorebird.yaml

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cyberverse
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cyberverse.otf
    - family: Cyberverse Condensed
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cyberverse Condensed.otf
    - family: Rapier Zero Hollow
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Rapier Zero Hollow.otf
    - family: Mashetic
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Mashetic.otf
    - family: Icomoon
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/icomoon.ttf
